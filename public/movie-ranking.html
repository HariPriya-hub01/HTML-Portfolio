<h1>Captivating Web series</h1> 
<h2>My 3 most favourite web series of all time!</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Top 3<br>Stranger Things</h3>
<p>A really thrilling storyline that kept me at the edge of my couch till the end. I was able to connect with each character and quite literally feel the fear in my bones!
    The actors were perfectly chosen for the right characters and brought out the emotions well. Their acting skills are commendable. Although I lost all my sleep over it, I loved the series so much!

<h3>Top 2 <br> Virgin River</h3>
<p>A heartfelt and soothing to the soul kinda series, its been a long time since I watched such optimistic web series. Absolutely no negativity, end of the day every character was right in their own way! If everyone around us in our society can pitch in and help each other this world will be such a happy place. The actors were on point and amazing screenplay. I used to think this kind of series would usually end up boring and would seem lengthy but Virgin River proved me wrong. Every episode ended with a suspense and when the series ended I felt sad that I wont be able to see them again, thats how well the characters bonded with the viewers.  Definitely a breath of fresh air!</p>
<h3>Top 1<br>The Good Doctor</h3>
<p>Tremendously inspiring. Its an amazing thought process to throw some light on the life of autistic people and how much they struggle with the society. Equity is important and the way they showed how Dr.Shawn was first perceived and later appreciated for his talent would surely remind everyone before judging others to think twice. It was a proud moment when the other fellow doctors were trying to think how Dr.Shawn would think in their situation. Every person is born with gifts, its upto us to figure out. Can't lie but Dr.Shawn had me jealous with his pictographic memory!</p>
